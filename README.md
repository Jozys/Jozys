### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**Jozys/Jozys** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

My name is Joshua and I am a (mostly) front end developer from Germany. Most of the time I work on react-native applications for frontend and some backend stuff, for school projects, see at @ProjektKursInfo.
